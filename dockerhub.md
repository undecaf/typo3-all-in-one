This project provides a ready-to-run and extensive
[TYPO3](https://typo3.org/)&nbsp;8.7/9.5/10.4 installation as a single container image.
It is widely configurable, and thus it addresses TYPO3 editors and administrators
as well as integrators and extension developers. Builds of the TYPO3 development
branches are available, too.

The image is based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), comes
with up-to-date versions of [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/),
[PHP](https://php.net/) and [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) 
and has [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) built in to choose from.
It is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box),
uses well below 500&nbsp;MB disk space and can run in
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/).
No additional container is required, and only a browser is needed
at the host to get going.


Setting up and managing usage scenarios is simplified by a
[shell script](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#t3-shell-script-reference) for Linux and macOS.

TYPO3 directories can be 
[mapped from the container to the host](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#using-an-ide).
You can use your favorite IDE at the host to
[develop for TYPO3](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#developing-for-typo3) in the container without having to
fiddle with host permissions.

[Secure connections](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#https-connections),
[logging (also to an external syslog host)](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#logging),
[Composer Mode](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/master/en-us/ExtensionInstallation/Index.html#install-extension-with-composer),
[remote debugging with XDebug](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#debugging-with-xdebug) and
[database access](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#accessing-the-typo3-database) are supported.
Your personal extension directories can be
[excluded from updates made by Composer](https://github.com/undecaf/typo3-in-a-box#preventing-composer-from-overwriting-your-changes).
